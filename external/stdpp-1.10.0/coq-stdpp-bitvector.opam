synopsis: "A library for bitvectors based on std++"
description: """
This library provides the `bv n` type for representing n-bit bitvectors (i.e.,
fixed-size integers with n bits). It comes with definitions for the standard operations
(e.g., the operations exposed by SMT-LIB) and some basic automation for solving bitvector
goals based on the lia tactic.
