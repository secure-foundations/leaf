This file lists "large-ish" changes to the std++ Coq library, but not every
API-breaking change is listed.

## std++ 1.10.0 (2024-04)

The highlight of this release is the bitvector library with support for
fixed-size integers. It is distributed as a separate package,
`coq-stdpp-bitvector`. The library is developed and maintained by Michael
Sammler.

std++ 1.10 supports Coq 8.18 and 8.19.
Coq 8.16 and 8.17 are no longer supported.

This release of std++ was managed by Ralf Jung and Robbert Krebbers, with
contributions from Mathias Adam Møller, Michael Sammler, Pierre Rousselin,
Pierre Roux, and Thibaut Pérami. Thanks a lot to everyone involved!

**Detailed list of changes:**

- Add `TCSimpl` type class that is similar to `TCEq` but performs `simpl`
  before proving the goal by reflexivity.
- Add new typeclass `MThrow E M` to generally represent throwing an error of
  type `E` in monad `M`. (by Thibaut Pérami and Mathias Adam Møller)
  As a consequence:
  + Replace `MGuard` with `MThrow` and define `guard` in terms of `MThrow`.
  + The new `guard` is an ordinary function, while the old guard was a notation.
    Hence, use the monadic bind to compose guards. For example, write
    `guard P;; m`/`p ← guard P; m` instead of `guard P; m`/`guard P as p; m`.
  + Replace the tactic `case_option_guard` with a more general `case_guard`
    version.
- Equip `solve_proper` with support for subrelations. When the goal is `R x y`
  and an assumption `R' x y` is found, we search for an instance of
  `SolveProperSubrelation R' R` and if we find one, that finishes the proof.
- Remove `wf` alias for the standard `well_founded`.
- Add lemmas `Nat.lt_wf_0_projected`, `N.lt_wf_0_projected`, `Z.lt_wf_projected`
  for easy measure/size induction.
- Add `inv` tactic as a more well-behaved alternative to `inversion_clear`
  (inspired by CompCert), and `oinv` as its version on open terms.
  These tactics support both named hypotheses (`inv H`) and using a number
  to refer to a hypothesis on the goal (`inv 1`).
- Add `prod_swap : A * B → B * A` and some basic theory about it.
- Add lemma `join_app`.
- Allow patterns and type annotations in `propset` notation, e.g.,
  `{[ (x, y) : nat * nat | x = y ]}`. (by Thibaut Pérami)
- Add `inv select` and `inversion select` tactics that allow selecting the
  to-be-inverted hypothesis with a pattern.
- The new `coq-stdpp-bitvector` package contains a library for `n`-bit
  bitvectors (i.e., fixed-size integers with `n` bits).
  Users of the previous unstable version need to change the import path from
  `stdpp.unstable.bitvector` to `stdpp.bitvector.definitions` and from
  `stdpp.unstable.bitvector_tactics` to `stdpp.bitvector.tactics`. The
  complete library can be imported with `stdpp.bitvector.bitvector`.
  (by Michael Sammler)

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming
(on macOS, replace `sed` by `gsed`, installed via e.g. `brew install gnu-sed`).
Note that the script is not idempotent, do not run it twice.
```
sed -i -E -f- $(find theories -name "*.v") <<EOF
# well_founded
s/\bwf\b/well_founded/g
EOF
```

## std++ 1.9.0 (2023-10-11)

This highlights of this release are:
* `gmap` and related types are re-implemented based on Appel and Leroy's
  [Efficient Extensional Binary Tries](https://inria.hal.science/hal-03372247),
  making them usable in nested inductive definitions and improving
  extensionality. More information can be found in Robbert Krebbers' Coq
  Workshop talk, see https://coq-workshop.gitlab.io/2023/
* New tactics `ospecialize`, `odestruct`, `oinversion` etc are added. These
  tactics improve upon `efeed` / `edestruct` by allowing one to leave more terms
  open when specializing arguments. For instance, `odestruct (H _ x)` will turn
  the `_` into an evar rather than trying to infer it immediately, making it
  usable in many situations where `edestruct` fails. This can significantly
  shorten the overhead involved in forward reasoning proofs. For more
  information, see the test cases provided here:
  https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp/-/blob/master/tests/tactics.v#L114

std++ 1.9 supports Coq 8.16 to 8.18. Coq 8.12 to 8.15 are no longer supported.

This release of std++ was managed by Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, and Johannes
Hostert, with contributions from Dorian Lesbre, Herman Bergwerf, Ike Mulder,
Isaak van Bakel, Jan-Oliver Kaiser, Jonas Kastberg, Marijn van Wezel, Michael
Sammler, Paolo Giarrusso, Tej Chajed, and Thibaut Pérami. Thanks a lot to
everyone involved!

**Detailed list of changes:**

- Rename `difference_difference` → `difference_difference_l` and
  `difference_difference_L` → `difference_difference_l_L`, add
  `difference_difference_r` and `difference_difference_r_L`.
- Let `set_solver` use `eauto` (instead of `idtac`) as its default solver.
- Add tactic `tc_solve` (this was `iSolveTC` in Iris).
- Change `f_equiv` to use `reflexivity` in a way similar to `f_equal`. That is,
  let `f_equiv` solve goals and subgoals of the form `R x x`. However, we use
  a restricted `fast_reflexivity` as full `reflexivity` can be quite expensive.
- Rename `loopup_total_empty` → `lookup_total_empty`.
- Let `naive_solver tac` fail if `tac` creates new evars. Before it would
  succeed with a proof that contains unresolved evars/shelved goals.
- Add lemmas `Nat.mul_reg_{l,r}` for cancellation of multiplication on `nat`.
  (Names are analogous to the `Z.` lemmas for Coq's standard library.)
- Rename `map_preimage` into `map_preimg` to be consistent with `dom`.
- Improve `bijective_finite`: do not require an inverse, do not unnecessarily
  remove duplicates.
- Add operation `*:` for "scalar" multiplication of multisets.
- Add `by` parameter to `multiset_solver`, which defaults to `eauto`.
- Add `map_img` operator for map image/codomain and some lemmas about it. (by
  Dorian Lesbre)
- Remove `Permutation_alt`, `submseteq_Permutation_length_le`, and
  `submseteq_Permutation_length_eq`; use `submseteq_length_Permutation` instead.
- Remove `map_to_list_length` (which seemed to be an unneeded auxiliary lemma);
  use `map_subset_size` instead.
- Rename `prefix_lookup` → `prefix_lookup_Some`.
- Extend `set_solver` with support for `set_Forall` and `set_Exists`.
- Change `lookup_union` lemma statement to use `∪` on maps instead of `union_with`.
- Add `set_omap` function for finite sets and associated lemmas. (by Dorian
  Lesbre)
- Add proof that `vec` is `Finite`. (by Herman Bergwerf.)
- Add `min` and `max` infix notations for `positive`.
- Add lemma `map_zip_fst_snd`.
- Add `stdpp.ssreflect` to provide compatibility with the ssreflect tactics.
- Set `simpl never` for `Pos` and `N` operations (similar to `Z`).
- Add `Intersection` instance for `option`. (by Marijn van Wezel)
- Add `lookup_intersection` lemma for the distributivity of lookup on an
  intersection. (by Marijn van Wezel)
- Add lemmas `map_filter_or` and `map_filter_and` for the union and intersection
  of filters on maps. (by Marijn van Wezel)
- Set `Hint Mode Equiv !`; this might need some type annotations for ambiguous
  uses of `≡`.
- Set `intuition_solver ::= auto` (the default is `auto with *`) instead of
  redeclaring `intuition`.
- Rename `option_union_Some` → `union_Some`, and strengthen it to become a
  biimplication.
- Provide new implementations of `gmap`/`gset`, `Pmap`/`Pset`, `Nmap`/`Nset` and
  `Zmap`/`Zset` based on the "canonical" version of binary tries by Appel and
  Leroy (see https://inria.hal.science/hal-03372247) that avoid the use of Sigma
  types. This has several benefits:
  + Maps enjoy more definitional equalities, because they are no longer equipped
    with a proof of canonicity. This means more equalities can be proved by
    `reflexivity` or even by conversion as part of unification. For example,
    `{[ 1 := 1; 2 := 2 ]} = {[ 2 := 2; 1 := 1 ]}` and `{[ 1 ]} ∖ {[ 1 ]} = ∅`
    hold definitionally.
  + Maps can be used in nested recursive definitions. For example,
    `Inductive gtest := GTest : gmap nat gtest → gtest`. (The old map types
    would violate Coq's strict positivity condition due to the Sigma type.)
- Make `map_fold` a primitive of the `FinMap`, and derive `map_to_list` from it.
  (`map_fold` used to be derived from `map_to_list`.) This makes it possible to
  use `map_fold` in nested-recursive definitions on maps. For example,
  `Fixpoint f (t : gtest) := let 'GTest ts := t in map_fold (λ _ t', plus (f t')) 1 ts`.
- Make `fin` number literal notations work with numbers above 10. (by Thibaut
  Pérami)
- Bind `fin` type to `fin` scope, so function taking a `fin` as argument will
  implicitly parse it in `fin` scope. (by Thibaut Pérami)
- Change premise `Equivalence` into `PreOrder` for `set_fold_proper`.
- Weaken `Proper` premises of `set_ind`, `set_fold_ind`, `set_fold_proper`. If
  you use `solve_proper` to solve these premises, no change should be needed. If
  you use a manual proof, you have to remove some `intros` and/or a `split`.
- Change `Params` of `lookup` and `lookup_total` from 4 to 5 to disable setoid
  rewriting in the key argument. If you have `Proper ((=) ==> R ==> S) lookup`,
  you should change that to `∀ k, Proper (R ==> S) (lookup k)`.
- Add lemmas for moving functions in and out of fold operations across data
  structures: new lemmas exist for sets, gmultisets, finite maps, and lists.
  (by Isaac van Bakel)
  + For the above structures, added lemmas which allow rewriting between
    `g (fold f x s)` and `fold f (g x) s` for appropriately-chosen functions
    `f`, `g` which commute.
  + For the above structures, add strong versions of the above lemmas that
    relate `g (fold f x s)` and `fold f (g x) s` by any preorder respected by
    `f`, `g` restricted to the elements of `s`.
  + Add `gmultiset_set_fold_disj_union_strong`, which generalizes
    `gmultiset_set_fold_disj_union` to any preorder for appropriately-chosen
    fold functions.
- Improve efficiency of `encode`/`decode` for `string` and `ascii`.
- Rename `equiv_Forall2` → `list_equiv_Forall2` and `equiv_option_Forall2` →
  `option_equiv_Forall2`. Add similar lemmas `list_eq_Forall2` and
  `option_eq_Forall2` for `=` instead of `≡`.
- Rename `fmap_inj` → `list_fmap_eq_inj` and `option_fmap_inj` →
  `option_fmap_eq_inj`. The new lemmas `list_fmap_inj`/`option_fmap_inj`
  generalize injectivity to `Forall2`/`option_Forall2`.
- Generalize `set_map`, `set_bind`, `set_omap`, `map_to_set` and `map_img`
  lemmas from `Set_` to `SemiSet`.
- Rename `sub_add'` to `add_sub'` for consistency with Coq's `add_sub` lemma.
- Rename `map_filter_lookup` → `map_lookup_filter` and
  `map_filter_lookup_Some` → `map_lookup_filter_Some` and
  `map_filter_lookup_None` → `map_lookup_filter_None`.
- Add `map_compose` operation, notation `m ∘ₘ n`, and associated lemmas.
  (by Dorian Lesbre)
- Add `Assoc`, `Comm`, `LeftId`, `RightId`, `LeftAbsorb`, `RightAbsorb`
  instances for number types.
- Add tactics `odestruct`, `oinversion`, `opose proof`, `ospecialize`,
  `ogeneralize` that work with open terms. All `_` remaining after inference
  will be turned into evars or subgoals using the same heuristic as `refine`.
  For instance, with `H: ∀ n, P n → Q n`, `ospecialize (H _ _)` will create an
  evar for `n` and open a subgoal for `P ?n`. `odestruct` is a more powerful
  version of `edestruct` that does not require all `_` in the destructed term to
  be immediately inferred.
- Replace `feed`/`efeed` tactics by variants of the `o` tactics that
  automatically add extra `_` until there are no more leading `∀`/`→`. `efeed
  tac` becomes `otac*`; the `feed` variants (that only specialize `→` but not
  `∀`) are no longer provided.
- Add lemmas for `reverse` of `take`/`drop` and `take`/`drop` of `reverse`.
- Rework lemmas for `take`/`drop` of an `++`:
  + Add `take_app` and `drop_app`, which are the strongest versions, and use
    `take_app_X` for derived versions.
  + Consistently use `'` suffix for version with premise `n = length`, and have
    versions without `'` with `length` inlined.
  + Rename `take_app` → `take_app_length`, `take_app_alt` → `take_app_length'`,
    `take_add_app` → `take_app_add'`, `take_app3_alt` → `take_app3_length'`,
    `drop_app` → `drop_app_length`, `drop_app_alt` → `drop_app_length'`,
    `drop_add_app` → `drop_app_add'`, `drop_app3_alt` → `drop_app3_length'`.
- Add instance `cons_equiv_inj`.

**Changes in `stdpp_unstable`:**

- Add bitvector number literal notations. (by Thibaut Pérami)

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming
(on macOS, replace `sed` by `gsed`, installed via e.g. `brew install gnu-sed`).
Note that the script is not idempotent, do not run it twice.

## std++ 1.8.0 (2022-08-18)

Coq 8.16 is newly supported by this release, and Coq 8.12 to 8.15 remain
supported. Coq 8.11 is no longer supported.

This release of std++ was managed by Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, and Lennard
Gäher, with contributions from Andrej Dudenhefner, Dan Frumin, Gregory Malecha,
Jan-Oliver Kaiser, Lennard Gäher, Léo Stefanesco, Michael Sammler, Paolo G. Giarrusso,
Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, and Vincent Siles. Thanks a lot to everyone involved!

- Make sure that `gset` and `mapset` do not bump the universe.
- Rewrite `tele_arg` to make it not bump universes. (by Gregory Malecha, BedRock
  Systems)
- Change `dom D M` (where `D` is the domain type) to `dom M`; the domain type is
  now inferred automatically. To make this possible, getting the domain of a
  `gmap` as a `coGset` and of a `Pmap` as a `coPset` is no longer supported. Use
  `gset_to_coGset`/`Pset_to_coPset` instead.
  When combining `dom` with `≡`, this can run into an old issue (due to a Coq
  issue, `Equiv` does not the desired `Hint Mode !`), which can make it
  necessary to annotate the set type at the `≡` via `≡@{D}`.
- Rename "unsealing" lemmas from `_eq` to `_unseal`. This affects `ndot_eq` and
  `nclose_eq`. These unsealing lemmas are internal, so in principle you should
  not rely on them.
- Declare `Hint Mode` for `FinSet A C` so that `C` is input, and `A` is output
  (i.e., inferred from `C`).
- Add function `map_preimage` to compute the preimage of a finite map.
- Rename `map_disjoint_subseteq` → `kmap_subseteq` and
  `map_disjoint_subset` → `kmap_subset`.
- Add `map_Exists` as an analogue to `map_Forall`. (by Michael Sammler)
- Add `case_match eqn:H` that behaves like `case_match` but allows naming the
  generated equality. (by Michael Sammler)
- Flip direction of `map_disjoint_fmap`.
- Add `map_agree` as a weaker version of `##ₘ` which requires the maps to agree
  on keys contained in both maps. (by Michael Sammler)
- Rename `lookup_union_l` → `lookup_union_l'` and add `lookup_union_l`
  as the dual to `lookup_union_r`.
- Add `map_seqZ` as the `Z` analogue of `map_seq`. (by Michael Sammler)
- Add the `coq-stdpp-unstable` package for libraries that are not
  deemed stable enough to be included in the main std++ library,
  following the `coq-iris-unstable` package. This library is contained
  in the `stdpp_unstable` folder. The `theories` folder was renamed
  to `stdpp`.
- Add an unstable `bitblast` tactic for solving equalities between integers
  involving bitwise operations. (by Michael Sammler)
- Add the bind operation `set_bind` for finite sets. (by Dan Frumin and Paolo G.
  Giarrusso)
- Change `list_fmap_ext` and `list_fmap_equiv_ext` to require equality on the
  elements of the list, not on all elements of the carrier type. This change
  makes these lemmas consistent with those for maps.
- Use the modules `Nat`, `Pos`, `N`, `Z`, `Nat2Z`, `Z2Nat`, `Nat2N`, `Pos2Nat`,
  `SuccNat2Pos`, and `N2Z` for our extended results on number types. Before,
  we prefixed our the std++ lemmas with `Nat_` or `nat_`, but now you refer
  to them with `Nat.`, similar to the way you refer to number lemmas from Coq's
  standard library.
- Use a module `Qp` for our positive rationals library. You now refer to `Qp`
  lemmas using `Qp.lem` instead of `Qp_lem`.
- Rename `_plus`/`_minus` into `_add`/`_sub` to be consistent with Coq's current
  convention for numbers. See the sed script below for an exact list of renames.
- Refactor the `feed` and `efeed` tactics. In particular, improve the
  documentation of `(e)feed` tactics, rename the primitive `(e)feed`
  tactic to `(e)feed_core`, make the syntax of `feed_core` consistent
  with `efeed_core`, remove the `by` parameter of `efeed_core`, and add
  `(e)feed generalize`, `efeed inversion`, and `efeed destruct`.

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming
(on macOS, replace `sed` by `gsed`, installed via e.g. `brew install gnu-sed`).

lot to everyone involved!

- Add `is_closed_term` tactic for determining whether a term depends on variables bound
  in the context. (by Michael Sammler)
- Add `list.zip_with_take_both` and `list.zip_with_take_both'`
- Specialize `list.zip_with_take_{l,r}`, add generalized lemmas `list.zip_with_take_{l,r}'`
- Add `bool_to_Z` that converts true to 1 and false to 0. (by Michael Sammler)

## std++ 1.6.0 (2021-11-05)

Coq 8.14 is newly supported by this release, and Coq 8.10 to 8.13 remain
supported.

This release of std++ was managed by Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, and Tej
Chajed, with contributions from Alix Trieu, Andrej Dudenhefner, Dan Frumin,
Fengmin Zhu, Hoang-Hai Dang, Jan Menz, Lennard Gäher, Michael Sammler, Paolo G.
Giarrusso, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, Simon Friis Vindum, Simon Gregersen, and
Tej Chajed. Thanks a lot to everyone involved!

- Remove singleton notations `{[ x,y ]}` and `{[ x,y,z ]}` for `{[ (x,y) ]}`
  and `{[ (x,y,z) ]}`. They date back to the time we used the `singleton` class
  with a product for maps (there's now the `singletonM` class).
- Add map notations `{[ k1 := x1 ; .. ; kn := xn ]}` up to arity 13.
  (by Lennard Gäher)
- Add multiset literal notation `{[+ x1; .. ; xn +]}`.
  + Add a new type class `SingletonMS` (with projection `{[+ x +]}` for
    multiset singletons.
  + Define `{[+ x1; .. ; xn +]}` as notation for `{[+ x1 +]} ⊎ .. ⊎ {[+ xn +]}`.
- Remove the `Singleton` and `Semiset` instances for multisets to avoid
  accidental use.
  + This means the notation `{[ x1; .. ; xn ]}` no longer works for multisets
    (previously, its definition was wrong, since it used `∪` instead of `⊎`).
  + Add lemmas for `∈` and `∉` specific for multisets, since the set lemmas no
    longer work for multisets.
- Make `Qc_of_Z'` not an implicit coercion (from `Z` to `Qc`) any more.
- Make `Z.of_nat'` not an implicit coercion (from `nat` to `Z`) any more.
- Rename `decide_left` → `decide_True_pi` and `decide_right` → `decide_False_pi`.
- Add `option_guard_True_pi`.
- Add lemma `surjective_finite`. (by Alix Trieu)
- Add type classes `TCFalse`, `TCUnless`, `TCExists`, and `TCFastDone`. (by
  Michael Sammler)
- Add various results about bit representations of `Z`. (by Michael Sammler)
- Add tactic `learn_hyp`. (by Michael Sammler)

  + Replace `equiv_Some_inv_l`, `equiv_Some_inv_r`, `equiv_Some_inv_l'`, and
    `equiv_Some_inv_r'` by new lemma `Some_equiv_eq` that follows the pattern of
    other `≡`-inversion lemmas: it uses a `↔` and puts the arguments of `≡` and
    `=` in consistent order.
- Setoid results for lists:
  + Add `≡`-inversion lemmas `nil_equiv_eq`, `cons_equiv_eq`,
    `list_singleton_equiv_eq`,  and `app_equiv_eq`.

- Improvements to `head` and `tail` functions for lists:
  + Define `head` as notation that prints (Coq defines it as `parsing only`)
    similar to `tail`.
  + Declare `tail` as `simpl nomatch`.
  + Add lemmas about `head` and `tail`.
- Add and extend equivalences between closure operators:
  - Add `↔` lemmas that relate `rtc`, `tc`, `nsteps`, and `bsteps`.
  - Rename `→` lemmas `rtc_nsteps` → `rtc_nsteps_1`,
    `nsteps_rtc` → `rtc_nsteps_2`, `rtc_bsteps` → `rtc_bsteps_1`, and
    `bsteps_rtc` → `rtc_bsteps_2`.
  - Add lemmas that relate `rtc`, `tc`, `nsteps`, and `bsteps` to path
    representations as lists.
- Remove explicit equality from cross split lemmas so that they become easier
  to use in forward-style proofs.
- Add lemmas for finite maps: `dom_map_zip_with`, `dom_map_zip_with_L`,
  `map_filter_id`, `map_filter_subseteq`, and `map_lookup_zip_Some`.
- Add lemmas for sets: `elem_of_weaken` and `not_elem_of_weaken`.
- Rename `insert_delete` → `insert_delete_insert`; add new `insert_delete` that
  is consistent with `delete_insert`.
- Fix statement of `sum_inhabited_r`. (by Paolo G. Giarrusso)
- Make `done` work on goals of the form `is_Some`.
- Add `mk_evar` tactic to generate evars (intended as a more useful replacement
  for Coq's `evar` tactic).
- Make `solve_ndisj` able to solve more goals of the form `_ ⊆ ⊤ ∖ _`,
  `_ ∖ _ ## _`, `_ ## _ ∖ _`, as well as `_ ## ∅` and `∅ ## _`,
  and goals containing `_ ∖ _ ∖ _`.
- Improvements to curry:
  + Swap names of `curry`/`uncurry`, `curry3`/`uncurry3`, `curry4`/`uncurry4`,
    `gmap_curry`/`gmap_uncurry`, and `hcurry`/`huncurry` to be consistent with
    Haskell and friends.
  + Add `Params` and `Proper` instances for `curry`/`uncurry`,
    `curry3`/`uncurry3`, and `curry4`/`uncurry4`.
  + Add lemmas that say that `curry`/`curry3`/`curry4` and
    `uncurry`/`uncurry3`/`uncurry4` are inverses.
- Rename `map_union_subseteq_l_alt` → `map_union_subseteq_l'` and
  `map_union_subseteq_r_alt` → `map_union_subseteq_r'` to be consistent with
  `or_intro_{l,r}'`.
- Add `union_subseteq_l'`, `union_subseteq_r'` as transitive versions of
  `union_subseteq_l`, `union_subseteq_r` that can be more easily `apply`ed.
- Rename `gmultiset_elem_of_singleton_subseteq` → `gmultiset_singleton_subseteq_l`
  and swap the equivalence to be consistent with Iris's `singleton_included_l`. Add
  `gmultiset_singleton_subseteq`, which is similar to `singleton_included` in
  Iris.
- Add lemmas `singleton_subseteq_l` and `singleton_subseteq` for sets.
- Add lemmas `map_singleton_subseteq_l` and `map_singleton_subseteq` for maps.
- Add lemmas `singleton_submseteq_l` and `singleton_submseteq` for unordered
  list inclusion, as well as `lookup_submseteq` and `submseteq_insert`.
- Make `map_empty` a biimplication.
- Clean up `empty{',_inv,_iff}` lemmas:
  + Write them all using `↔` and consistently use the `_iff` suffix.
    (But keep the `_inv` version when it is useful for rewriting.)
  + Remove `map_to_list_empty_inv_alt`; chain `Permutation_nil_r` and
    `map_to_list_empty_iff` instead.
  + Add lemma `map_filter_empty_iff`.
- Add generalized lemma `map_filter_insert` that covers both the True and False
  case. Rename old `map_filter_insert` → `map_filter_insert_True` and
  `map_filter_insert_not_delete` → `map_filter_insert_False`.
- Weaken premise of `map_filter_delete_not` to make it consistent with
  `map_filter_insert_not'`.
- Add lemmas for maps: `map_filter_strong_subseteq_ext`, `map_filter_subseteq_ext`,
  `map_filter_subseteq_mono`, `map_filter_singleton`, `map_filter_singleton_True`,
  `map_filter_singleton_False`, `map_filter_comm`, `map_union_least`,
  `map_subseteq_difference_l`, `insert_difference`, `insert_difference'`,
  `difference_insert`, `difference_insert_subseteq`. (by Hai Dang)
- Add `map_size_disj_union`, `size_dom`, `size_list_to_set`.
- Tweak reduction on `gset`, so that `cbn` matches the behavior by `simpl` and
  does not unfold `gset` operations. (by Paolo G. Giarrusso, BedRock Systems)
- Add `get_head` tactic to determine the syntactic head of a function
  application term.
- Add map lookup lemmas: `lookup_union_is_Some`, `lookup_difference_is_Some`,
  `lookup_union_Some_l_inv`, `lookup_union_Some_r_inv`.
- Make `Forall2_nil`, `Forall2_cons` bidirectional lemmas with `Forall2_nil_2`,
  `Forall2_cons_2` being the original one-directional versions (matching
  `Forall_nil` and `Forall_cons`). Rename `Forall2_cons_inv` to `Forall2_cons_1`.
- Enable `f_equiv` (and by extension `solve_proper`) to handle goals of the form
  `f x ≡ g x` when `f ≡ g` is in scope, where `f` has a type like Iris's `-d>`
  and `-n>`.
- Optimize `f_equiv` by doing more syntactic checking before handing off to
  unification. This can make some uses 50x faster, but also makes the tactic
  slightly weaker in case the left-hand side and right-hand side of the relation
  call a function with arguments that are convertible but not syntactically
  equal.
- Add lemma `choose_proper` showing that `choose P` respects predicate
  equivalence. (by Paolo G. Giarrusso, BedRock Systems)
- Extract module `well_founded` from `relations`, and re-export it for
  compatibility. This contains `wf`, `Acc_impl`, `wf_guard`,
  `wf_projected`, `Fix_F_proper`, `Fix_unfold_rel`.
- Add induction principle `well_founded.Acc_dep_ind`, a dependent
  version of `Acc_ind`. (by Paolo G. Giarrusso, BedRock Systems)

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming
(on macOS, replace `sed` by `gsed`, installed via e.g. `brew install gnu-sed`).
Note that the script is not idempotent, do not run it twice.

## std++ 1.5.0 (2021-02-16)

Coq 8.13 is newly supported by this release, Coq 8.8 and 8.9 are no longer
supported.

This release of std++ was managed by Ralf Jung and Robbert Krebbers, with
contributions by Alix Trieu, Dan Frumin, Hugo Herbelin, Paulo Emílio de Vilhena,
Simon Friis Vindum, and Tej Chajed.  Thanks a lot to everyone involved!

- Overhaul of the theory of positive rationals `Qp`:
  + Add `max` and `min` operations for `Qp`.
  + Add the orders `Qp_le` and `Qp_lt`.
  + Rename `Qp_plus` into `Qp_add` and `Qp_mult` into `Qp_mul` to be consistent
    with the corresponding names for `nat`, `N`, and `Z`.
  + Add a function `Qp_inv` for the multiplicative inverse.
  + Define the division function `Qp_div` in terms of `Qp_inv`, and generalize
    the second argument from `positive` to `Qp`.
  + Add a function `pos_to_Qp` that converts a `positive` into a positive
    rational `Qp`.
  + Add many lemmas and missing type class instances, especially for orders,
    multiplication, multiplicative inverse, division, and the conversion.
  + Remove the coercion from `Qp` to `Qc`. This follows our recent tradition of
    getting rid of coercions since they are more often confusing than useful.
  + Rename the conversion from `Qp_car : Qp → Qc` into `Qp_to_Qc` to be
    consistent with other conversion functions in std++. Also rename the lemma
    `Qp_eq` into `Qp_to_Qc_inj_iff`.
  + Use `let '(..) = ...` in the definitions of `Qp_plus`, `Qp_mult`, `Qp_inv`,
    `Qp_le` and `Qp_lt` to avoid Coq tactics (like `injection`) to unfold these
    definitions eagerly.
  + Define the `Qp` literals 1, 2, 3, 4 in terms of `pos_to_Qp` instead of
    iterated addition.
  + Rename and restate many lemmas so as to be consistent with the conventions
    for Coq's number types `nat`, `N`, and `Z`.
- Add `rename select <pat> into <name>` tactic to find a hypothesis by pattern
  and give it a fixed name.
- Add `eunify` tactic that lifts Coq's `unify` tactic to `open_constr`.
- Generalize `omap_insert`, `omap_singleton`, `map_size_insert`, and
  `map_size_delete` to cover the `Some` and `None` case. Add `_Some` and `_None`
  versions of the lemmas for the specific cases.
- Rename `dom_map filter` → `dom_filter`, `dom_map_filter_L` → `dom_filter_L`,
  and `dom_map_filter_subseteq` → `dom_filter_subseteq` for consistency's sake.
- Remove unused notations `∪**`, `∪*∪**`, `∖**`, `∖*∖**`, `⊆**`, `⊆1*`, `⊆2*`,
  `⊆1**`, `⊆2**"`, `##**`, `##1*`, `##2*`, `##1**`, `##2**` for nested
  `zip_with` and `Forall2` versions of `∪`, `∖`, and `##`.
- Remove unused type classes `DisjointE`, `DisjointList`, `LookupE`, and
  `InsertE`.
- Fix a bug where `pretty 0` was defined as `""`, the empty string. It now
  returns `"0"` for `N`, `Z`, and `nat`.
- Remove duplicate `map_fmap_empty` of `fmap_empty`, and rename
  `map_fmap_empty_inv` into `fmap_empty_inv` for consistency's sake.
- Rename `seq_S_end_app` to `seq_S`. (The lemma `seq_S` is also in Coq's stdlib
  since Coq 8.12.)
- Remove `omega` import and hint database in `tactics` file.
- Remove unused `find_pat` tactic that was made mostly obsolete by `select`.
- Rename `_11` and `_12` into `_1_1` and `_1_2`, respectively. These suffixes
  are used for `A → B1` and `A → B2` variants of `A ↔ B1 ∧ B2` lemmas.
- Rename `Forall_Forall2` → `Forall_Forall2_diag` to be consistent with the
  names for big operators in Iris.
- Rename set equality and equivalence lemmas:
  `elem_of_equiv_L` → `set_eq`,
  `set_equiv_spec_L` → `set_eq_subseteq`,
  `elem_of_equiv` → `set_equiv`,
  `set_equiv_spec` → `set_equiv_subseteq`.
- Remove lemmas `map_filter_iff` and `map_filter_lookup_eq` in favor of the stronger
  extensionality lemmas `map_filter_ext` and `map_filter_strong_ext`.

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming
(on macOS, replace `sed` by `gsed`, installed via e.g. `brew install gnu-sed`):

## std++ 1.4.0 (released 2020-07-15)

Coq 8.12 is newly supported by this release, and Coq 8.7 is no longer supported.

This release of std++ received contributions by Gregory Malecha, Michael
Sammler, Olivier Laurent, Paolo G. Giarrusso, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers,
sarahzrf, and Tej Chajed.

- Rename `Z2Nat_inj_div` and `Z2Nat_inj_mod` to `Nat2Z_inj_div` and
  `Nat2Z_inj_mod` to follow the naming convention of `Nat2Z` and
  `Z2Nat`. Re-purpose the names `Z2Nat_inj_div` and `Z2Nat_inj_mod` for be the
  lemmas they should actually be.
- Add `rotate` and `rotate_take` functions for accessing a list with
  wrap-around. Also add `rotate_nat_add` and `rotate_nat_sub` for
  computing indicies into a rotated list.
- Add the `select` and `revert select` tactics for selecting and
  reverting a hypothesis based on a pattern.
- Extract `list_numbers.v` from `list.v` and `numbers.v` for
  functions, which operate on lists of numbers (`seq`, `seqZ`,
  `sum_list(_with)` and `max_list(_with)`). `list_numbers.v` is
  exported by the prelude. This is a breaking change if one only
  imports `list.v`, but not the prelude.
- Rename `drop_insert` into `drop_insert_gt` and add `drop_insert_le`.
- Add `Countable` instance for `Ascii.ascii`.
- Make lemma `list_find_Some` more apply friendly.
- Add `filter_app` lemma.
- Add tactic `multiset_solver` for solving goals involving multisets.
- Rename `fin_maps.singleton_proper` into `singletonM_proper` since it concerns
  `singletonM` and to avoid overlap with `sets.singleton_proper`.
- Add `wn R` for weakly normalizing elements w.r.t. a relation `R`.
- Add `encode_Z`/`decode_Z` functions to encode elements of a countable type
  as integers `Z`, in analogy with `encode_nat`/`decode_nat`.
- Fix list `Datatypes.length` and string `strings.length` shadowing (`length`
  should now always be `Datatypes.length`).
- Change the notation for pattern matching monadic bind into `'pat ← x; y`. It
  was `''pat ← x; y` (with double `'`) due to a shortcoming of Coq ≤8.7.

## std++ 1.3.0 (released 2020-03-18)

Coq 8.11 is supported by this release.

This release of std++ received contributions by Amin Timany, Armaël Guéneau,
Dan Frumin, David Swasey, Jacques-Henri Jourdan, Michael Sammler, Paolo G.
Giarrusso, Pierre-Marie Pédrot, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, Simon Friis Vindum,
Tej Chajed, and William Mansky

Noteworthy additions and changes:

- Rename `dom_map_filter` into `dom_map_filter_subseteq` and repurpose
  `dom_map_filter` for the version with the equality. This follows the naming
  convention for similar lemmas.
- Generalize `list_find_Some` and `list_find_None` to become bi-implications.
- Disambiguate Haskell-style notations for partially applied operators. For
  example, change `(!! i)` into `(.!! x)` so that `!!` can also be used as a
  prefix, as done in VST. A sed script to perform the renaming can be found at:
  https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp/merge_requests/93
- Add type class `TopSet` for sets with a `⊤` element. Provide instances for
  `boolset`, `propset`, and `coPset`.
- Add `set_solver` support for `dom`.
- Rename `vec_to_list_of_list` into `vec_to_list_to_vec`, and add new lemma
  `list_to_vec_to_list` for the converse.
- Rename `fin_of_nat` into `nat_to_fin`, `fin_to_of_nat` into
  `fin_to_nat_to_fin`, and `fin_of_to_nat` into `nat_to_fin_to_nat`, to follow
  the conventions.
- Add `Countable` instance for `vec`.
- Introduce `destruct_or{?,!}` to repeatedly destruct disjunctions in
  assumptions. The tactic can also be provided an explicit assumption name;
  `destruct_and{?,!}` has been generalized accordingly and now can also be
  provided an explicit assumption name.
  Slight breaking change: `destruct_and` no longer handle `False`;
  `destruct_or` now handles `False` while `destruct_and` handles `True`,
  as the respective units of disjunction and conjunction.
- Add tactic `set_unfold in H`.
- Set `Hint Mode` for `TCAnd`, `TCOr`, `TCForall`, `TCForall2`, `TCElemOf`,
  `TCEq`, and `TCDiag`.
- Add type class `LookupTotal` with total lookup operation `(!!!) : M → K → A`.
  Provide instances for `list`, `fin_map`, and `vec`, as well as corresponding
  lemmas for the operations on these types. The instance for `vec` replaces the
  ad-hoc `!!!` definition. As a consequence, arguments of `!!!` are no longer
  parsed in `vec_scope` and `fin_scope`, respectively. Moreover, since `!!!`
  is overloaded, coercions around `!!!` no longer work.
- Make lemmas for `seq` and `seqZ` consistent:
  + Rename `fmap_seq` → `fmap_S_seq`
  + Add `fmap_add_seq`, and rename `seqZ_fmap` → `fmap_add_seqZ`
  + Rename `lookup_seq` → `lookup_seq_lt`
  + Rename `seqZ_lookup_lt` → `lookup_seqZ_lt`,
    `seqZ_lookup_ge` → `lookup_seqZ_ge`, and `seqZ_lookup` → `lookup_seqZ`
  + Rename `lookup_seq_inv` → `lookup_seq` and generalize it to a bi-implication
  + Add `NoDup_seqZ` and `Forall_seqZ`

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming
(on macOS, replace `sed` by `gsed`, installed via e.g. `brew install gnu-sed`):
```
sed -i '

## std++ 1.2.1 (released 2019-08-29)

This release of std++ received contributions by Dan Frumin, Michael Sammler,
Paolo G. Giarrusso, Paulo Emílio de Vilhena, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers,
Rodolphe Lepigre, and Simon Spies.

Noteworthy additions and changes:

- Introduce `max` and `min` infix notations for `N` and `Z` like we have for `nat`.
- Make `solve_ndisj` tactic more powerful.
- Add type class `Involutive`.
- Improve `naive_solver` performance in case the goal is trivially solvable.
- Add a bunch of new lemmas for list, set, and map operations.
- Rename `lookup_imap` into `map_lookup_imap`.

## std++ 1.2.0 (released 2019-04-26)

Coq 8.9 is supported by this release, but Coq 8.6 is no longer supported. Use
std++ 1.1 if you have to use Coq 8.6. The repository moved to a new location at
https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp and automatically generated Coq-doc of
master is available at https://plv.mpi-sws.org/coqdoc/stdpp/.

This release of std++ received contributions by Dan Frumin, Hai Dang, Jan-Oliver
Kaiser, Mackie Loeffel, Maxime Dénès, Ralf Jung, Robbert Krebbers, and Tej
Chajed.

New features:

- New notations `=@{A}`, `≡@{A}`, `∈@{A}`, `∉@{A}`, `##@{A}`, `⊆@{A}`, `⊂@{A}`,
  `⊑@{A}`, `≡ₚ@{A}` for being explicit about the type.
- A definition of basic telescopes `tele` and some theory about them.
- A simple type class based canceler `NatCancel` for natural numbers.
- A type `binder` for anonymous and named binders to be used in program language
  definitions with string-based binders.
- More results about `set_fold` on sets and multisets.
- Notions of infinite and finite predicates/sets and basic theory about them.
- New operation `map_seq`.
- The symmetric and reflexive/transitive/symmetric closure of a relation (`sc`
  and `rtsc`, respectively).
- Different notions of confluence (diamond property, confluence, local
  confluence) and the relations between these.
- A `size` function for finite maps and prove some properties.
- More results about `Qp` fractions.
- More miscellaneous results about sets, maps, lists, multisets.
- Various type class utilities, e.g. `TCEq`, `TCIf`, `TCDiag`, `TCNoBackTrack`,
  and `tc_to_bool`.
- Generalize `gset_to_propset` to `set_to_propset` for any `SemiSet`.

Changes:

- Consistently use `lia` instead of `omega` everywhere.
- Consistently block `simpl` on all `Z` operations.
- The `Infinite` class is now defined using a function `fresh : list A → A`
  that given a list `xs`, gives an element `fresh xs ∉ xs`.
- Make `default` an abbreviation for `from_option id` (instead of just swapping
  the argument order of `from_option`).
- More efficient `Countable` instance for `list` that is linear instead of
  exponential.
- Improve performance of `set_solver` significantly by introducing specialized
  type class `SetUnfoldElemOf` for propositions involving `∈`.
- Make `gset` a `Definition` instead of a `Notation` to improve performance.
- Use `disj_union` (notation `⊎`) for disjoint union on multisets (that adds the
  multiplicities). Repurpose `∪` on multisets for the actual union (that takes
  the max of the multiplicities).
- Set `Hint Mode` for `pretty`.

Naming:

- Consistently use the `set` prefix instead of the `collection` prefix for
  definitions and lemmas.
- Renaming of classes:
  + `Collection` into `Set_` (`_` since `Set` is a reserved keyword)
  + `SimpleCollection` into `SemiSet`
  + `FinCollection` into `FinSet`
  + `CollectionMonad` into `MonadSet`
- Types:
  + `set A := A → Prop` into `propset`
  + `bset := A → bool` into `boolset`.
- Files:
  + `collections.v` into `sets.v`
  + `fin_collections.v` into `fin_sets.v`
  + `bset` into `boolset`
  + `set` into `propset`
- Consistently use the naming scheme `X_to_Y` for conversion functions, e.g.
  `list_to_map` instead of the former `map_of_list`.

The following `sed` script should perform most of the renaming:

## std++ 1.1.0 (released 2017-12-19)

Coq 8.5 is no longer supported by this release of std++.  Use std++ 1.0 if you
have to use Coq 8.5.

New features:

- Many new lemmas about lists, vectors, sets, maps.
- Equivalence proofs between std++ functions and their alternative in the the
  Coq standard library, e.g. `List.nth`, `List.NoDop`.
- Typeclass versions of the logical connectives and list predicates:
  `TCOr`, `TCAnd`, `TCTrue`, `TCForall`, `TCForall2`.
- A function `tc_opaque` to make definitions type class opaque.
- A type class `Infinite` for infinite types.
- A generic implementation to obtain fresh elements of infinite types.
- More theory about curry and uncurry functions on `gmap`.
- A generic `filter` and `zip_with` operation on finite maps.
- A type of generic trees for showing that arbitrary types are countable.

Changes:

- Get rid of `Automatic Coercions Import`, it is deprecated.
  Also get rid of `Set Asymmetric Patterns`.
- Various changes and improvements to `f_equiv` and `solve_proper`.
- `Hint Mode` is now set for all operational type classes to make instance
  search less likely to diverge.
- New type class `RelDecision` for decidable relations, and `EqDecision` is
  defined in terms of it. This class allows to set `Hint Mode` properly.
- Use the flag `assert` of `Arguments` to make it more robust.
- The functions `imap` and `imap2` on lists are defined so that they enjoy more
  definitional equalities.
- Theory about `fin` is moved to its own file `fin.v`.
- Rename `preserving` → `mono`.

Changes to notations:

- Operational type classes for lattice notations: `⊑`,`⊓`, `⊔`, `⊤` `⊥`.
- Replace `⊥` for disjointness with `##`, so that `⊥` can be used for the
  bottom lattice element.
- All notations are now in `stdpp_scope` with scope key `stdpp`
  (formerly `C_scope` and `C`).
- Higher precedence for `.1` and `.2` that is compatible with ssreflect.
- Various changes to monadic notations to improve compatibility with Mtac2:
  + Pattern matching notation for monadic bind `'pat ← x; y` where `pat` can
    be any Coq pattern.
  + Change the level of the do-notation.
  + `<$>` is left associative.
  + Notation `x ;; y` for `_ ← x; y`.

## History

Coq-std++ has originally been developed by Robbert Krebbers as part of his
formalization of the C programming language in his PhD thesis, called
[CH2O](http://robbertkrebbers.nl/thesis.html). After that, Coq-std++ has been
part of the [Iris project](http://iris-project.org), and has continued to be
developed by Robbert Krebbers, Ralf Jung, and Jacques Henri-Jourdan.
