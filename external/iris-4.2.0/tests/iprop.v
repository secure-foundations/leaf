(** A [sigT] that is partially applied and template-polymorphic causes universe
inconsistency errors, which is why [sigT] should be avoided for the definition
of [gFunctors].

The following constructs a partially applied [sigT] that generates bad universe
constraints. This causes a universe inconsistency when [gFunctors] are
to be defined with [sigT]. *)
