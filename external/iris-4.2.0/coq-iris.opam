synopsis: "A Higher-Order Concurrent Separation Logic Framework with support for interactive proofs"
description: """
Iris is a framework for reasoning about the safety of concurrent programs using
concurrent separation logic. It can be used to develop a program logic, for
defining logical relations, and for reasoning about type systems, among other
applications. This package includes the base logic, Iris Proof Mode (IPM) /
MoSeL, and a general language-independent program logic; see coq-iris-heap-lang
for an instantiation of the program logic to a particular programming language.
