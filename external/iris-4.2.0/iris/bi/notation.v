(** The definition must coincide with "'⊢@{' PROP } Q". *)
Reserved Notation "'(⊢@{' PROP } Q )".
(**
Rationale:
Notation [( '⊢@{' PROP } )] prevents parsing [(⊢@{PROP} Q)] using the
[⊢@{PROP} Q] notation; since the latter parse arises from composing two
notations, it is missed by the automatic left-factorization.

To fix that, we force left-factorization by explicitly composing parentheses with
['⊢@{' PROP } Q] into the new notation [( '⊢@{' PROP } Q )],
which successfully undergoes automatic left-factoring. *)
