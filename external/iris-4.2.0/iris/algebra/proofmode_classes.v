(* The [IsOp a b1 b2] class is used in two directions: to "split" input [a] into
outputs [b1] and [b2], and to "merge" inputs [b1] and [b2] into output [a],
where in both cases we have [a ≡ b1 ⋅ b2].

Since the [IsOp a b1 b2] class is used in two directions, there are some
subtleties we need to account for:

- If we want to "merge", we want the "op" instance to be used *last*. That is,
  before using [IsOp (b1 ⋅ b2) b1 b2], we want to traverse the structure of the
  term to merge constructors, and we want it to combine terms like [q/2] and
  [q/2] into [q] instead of [q/2 ⋅ q/2].
- If we want to "split", we want the "op" instance to be used *first*. That is,
  we want to use [IsOp (b1 ⋅ b2) b1 b2] eagerly, so that for instance, a term
  like [q1 ⋅ q2] is turned into [q1] and [q2] and not two times [(q1 ⋅ q2) / 2].

To achieve this, there are various classes with different modes:

- [IsOp a b1 b2]. This class has no mode, so it can be used even to
  combine/merge evars. This class has only one direct instance
  [IsOp (a ⋅ b) a b] with cost 100 (so it is used last), ensuring that the
  "op" rule is used last when merging.
- [IsOp' a b1 b2]. This class requires either [a] OR both [b1] and [b2] to be inputs.
  All usual instances should be of this class to avoid loops.
- [IsOp'LR a b1 b2]. This class requires [a] to be an input and has just one
  instance [IsOp'LR (a ⋅ b) a b] with cost 0. This ensures that the "op"
  rule is used first when splitting.
