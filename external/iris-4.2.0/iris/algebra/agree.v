(** Define an agreement construction such that Agree A is discrete when A is discrete.
    Notice that this construction is NOT complete.  The following is due to Aleš:

Proposition: Ag(T) is not necessarily complete.
Proof.
  Let T be the set of binary streams (infinite sequences) with the usual
  ultrametric, measuring how far they agree.

  Let Aₙ be the set of all binary strings of length n. Thus for Aₙ to be a
  subset of T we have them continue as a stream of zeroes.

  Now Aₙ is a finite non-empty subset of T. Moreover {Aₙ} is a Cauchy sequence
  in the defined (Hausdorff) metric.

  However the limit (if it were to exist as an element of Ag(T)) would have to
  be the set of all binary streams, which is not exactly finite.

  Thus Ag(T) is not necessarily complete.
*)

(** Note that the projection [agree_car] is not non-expansive, so it cannot be
used in the logic. If you need to get a witness out, you should use the
lemma [to_agree_uninjN] instead. In general, [agree_car] should ONLY be used
internally in this file.  *)
